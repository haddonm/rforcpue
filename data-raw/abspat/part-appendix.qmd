# Appendix {#sec-appendix .unnumbered}

This appendix contains a number of sections that are typically included in the FRDC Final Report Standards. There are also several additional pieces of exploratory work that have been included here, that contain work that was done as part of this project but are only indirect (@sec-chapter13 provides an examination of the relationship between FIS and overlapping dive polygon catch rates), or were part of an extensive investigation into potential standardisation models and potential terms for inclusion (sec-chapter14, sec-chapter15, and sec-chapter16). In particular whether environmental variables contribute meaningfully to explaining variance in the catch rate data. While these later chapters utilised Docket return catch rate data, the exercise was hugely informative for the progression of the project and have considerable value to assist readers understanding of how we arrived where we did.
